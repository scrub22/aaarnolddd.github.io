Journaling##the philosophy behind the hobby##Sep. 05, 2019##Inspired by the <a title="Meditations" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">personal writings</a> of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, I always thought that journaling my life and thoughts could be an act comparable to meditation; and could be a way that I could release some stress. During the creation of this blog, I was conflicted about what the theme of this project would be, and it is funny that I am deciding to turn this blog into a journal, based on how the aesthetic of the website turned out to be.
