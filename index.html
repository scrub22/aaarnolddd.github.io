				<p>

					Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

				<h1><a href="#2">Journaling</a></h1>
				<h2>the philosophy behind the hobby</h2>
				<time datetime="2019-09-05">Sep. 05, 2019</time>

				<p>

					Inspired by the <a title="Meditations" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">personal writings</a> of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, I always thought that journaling my life and thoughts could be an act comparable to meditation; and could be a way that I could release some stress. During the creation of this blog, I was conflicted about what the theme of this project would be, and it is funny that I am deciding to turn this blog into a journal, based on how the aesthetic of the website turned out to be.

				<h1><a href="#3">First Journal</a></h1>
				<h2>Let's see if it's worth it</h2>
				<time datetime="2019-09-06">Sep. 06, 2019</time>

				<p>

					Journaling daily has been said to ease the symptoms of anxiety. Lately, I have been under some stress because time seems to be flying past quicker than I can keep track of; even my parents mentioned it today. I am at a major changing point in my life and it seems like I have to adapt quickly to avoid long-term suffering. However, reflecting back on this now; I think that maybe I should just take some time to calm down and learn to not take life so seriously.

				<h2>What does the future hold?</h2>

				<p>

					I have always taken some sort of pride in what I do in life. The process of creation, and putting something out into the world has always been something that has given me a tremendous sense of achievement. You can see this in things I have done in the past, such as creating my own .webs.com website, or trying to learn C++ with my highschool frend so that I may create my own video games. This passion still runs deep in my soul. I still want to create something, be it a podcast, another website, a portfolio, or whatever else I can think of. I want to turn these things into a career that I can actually enjoy. I think that what I really need to do is to wait and learn different things and try as many things as I can, so that I can decide what I want to do in my own time, and enjoy the process along then way, living free of anxiety and stress, and my own compulsive nature of wanting to do everything all at once.
